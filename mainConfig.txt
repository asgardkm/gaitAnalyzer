********INPUT CONFIGURATION FILE*********,

This file serves as the primary configuration file for the gait analyzing script.

It specifies parameters for selecting raw data column indexes, defines which ground reaction force directions are associated with which X Y Z Cartestian coordinate, and specifies the exposure groups of interest.

This file is divided into 2 sections.
The first section defines data parameters for data input and gait analysis
The second section defines markers to check the existance in order to process their respective function calls for gait analysis

% TEXT INDEXES + FREQUENCY + THRESHOLDS & BOUNDS

% TEXT INDEXES
%   set the indexes (columns) you wish to use from the text file (include 
%   forces or whole text file, or use 'default'-reads in all possible data)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PLEASE NOTE!!!! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU SET AND CHANGE COLUMN INDEXES YOU WISH    %%%
%%% TO SELECT FROM YOUR INPUT DATA IN YOUR TEXT DFLOW FILES             %%%
%%% - THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW YOUR DATA IS SET UP INTO ITS      %%%
%%%   COLUMNS - INPUT BELOW THE COLUMN INDEXES FOR THE MARKERS YOU      %%%
%%%   WISH TO LOOK AT                                                   %%%
%%% - OTHERWISE THE CODE WILL RETURN AN ERROR - IT CANNOT GUESS WHAT    %%%
%%%   COLUMNS AND MARKERS YOU WISH TO LOOK AT!!! (YET :))               %%%
%%% - 16nov2015 - implenting a 'default' to load EVERYTHING in the raw  %%%
%%%   data file if txt_idx is not manually changed below. You may or    %%%
%%%   may not want this because it is not always guaranteed to work!!   %%%
%%%   (default input arg: txt_idx = 'default');                         %%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% As of right now, only markers that have X Y Z coordinate in the     %%%
%%% string of the marker are considered when loading up text files!     %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% Ignore_idx only currently works if the indexes you wish to skip are %%%
%%% the very first columns (like columns 1 and 2) - this may not be true%%%
%%% now, but it hasn't been tested.                                     %%%
%%%									%%%
%%% old sample txt_idx examples                                         %%%
%%% txt_idx = 1:167;                                                    %%%
%%% txt_idx = 150:167;                                                  %%%

%FREQUENCY OF CAMERAS - defined below
%THRESHOLDS AND BOUNDS - defined below (do not need to be changed often, if at all, since these are parameters for finding proper gaitcycles from force thresholds, and have been fine tuned over the months so that these following parameters work without issue)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE : outdated! check the readme on the github page
	The MATLAB script mainScript.m reads in raw patient trial data and outputs parameter structures for the trial. The script is run in two parts, DATA PREPERATION and FINDING PARAMETERS

-	Note - make sure that the script and all necessary
	functions are in your current working directory.



=== INPUTS (DATA PREPARATION) : ====================================

	There are two types of inputs required to run mainConfig code, inputs within the code, and inputs that will appear in the prompt when the code is run.


--- MANAL INPUTS : -------------------------------------------------
	- txt_idx    - selecting the columns you wish to use if utilizing a text file (DFLOW) in any way shape or form. This is for
wheter you wish to use both marker and force data, or if you'd just like to use the force data when combining. Note that this requires you to know what is in your DFLOW datafile ( you may need to count).

	- frequency  - frequency of camera (originally set to 100).

	- threshold  - force threshold (originally set to 5, may not need be changed often).

	- LFB        - lower force boundary for finding gaitcycles (originally set to 5, may not need be changed often).

	- UFB        - upper force boundary for finding gaitcycles (originally set to 100, may not need be changed often).

	- gc_percent - percentage of gaitcycle to include in the gaitcycle vectors (originally set to 1, or 100%) 


--- PROMPT IMPUTS : ------------------------------------------------
- 	Prompt Input Options : 
		- 1 ) select your raw DFLOW txt datafile

		- 2 ) select your raw NEXUS csv datafile (currently not working)

		- 3 ) select combined preprocessed DFLOW+NEXUS csv datafile

		- 4 ) create a combined DFLOW+NEXUS csv datafile (and use it afterwards for finding parameters)



=== OUTPUTS (FINDING PARAMETERS) : =================================
	
	Note : based on your input file, not all parameters may be avaiable (no forces-> no gaitcycle (parameters) available in NEXUS csv only, no center of gravities available with files containing foot markers only, etc)

	As of right now, please comment out functions which your input raw trial data is not compatible with (subject to improvement in the future (with case structure)
